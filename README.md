Transbot is a multiway, multilanguage translator app that can read text from images recognise sign language and can convert it to destination langugage of the choice of the user.
This was my  btech project in which we created a webapp using python and flask. We created scripts using python and scikit learn that can read sign languge. Using pytesseract and PIL libraries we implemented a script that can extract text content from images and convert it to text of 
destination langugae using google trans library. The translated text can then be converted to audio for which the script uses playsound and gtts(google text to speech) library.
